# The Web Sequence Diagrams Used on My Blog

Recently, someone asked if I could make the (websequencediagams.com)[https://www.websequencediagrams.com] generated sequence diagrams markup available for some of my sequence diagrams I've craetd for blog posts. I went ahead and loaded all the ones I still had into this git repo. Hopefully, someone finds it useful.
