# The Web Sequence Diagrams Used in My Blog Posts

Recently, someone asked if I could make the [websequencediagams.com](https://www.websequencediagrams.com) generated sequence diagrams markup available for some of my diagrams I've craeted for blog posts. I went ahead and loaded all the ones I still had into this git repo. Hopefully, someone finds it useful.
